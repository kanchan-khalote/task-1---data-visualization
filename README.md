*DISCRIPTION* : 
The objective of Task-1 was to understand how real-time data can be collected from the internet using an API (Application Programming Interface) and then visualize that data using Python. In this task, I selected the OpenWeatherMap Public Weather API, which provides live and forecast weather information for any city. The task involved three major steps: API integration, data processing, and data visualization.

In the first step, I created a free account on OpenWeatherMap and generated an API key. This key is required to authenticate our request and gain access to weather data. After obtaining the key, I wrote a Python script to make a request to the API using the requests library. The API responded with weather data in JSON format, which contained forecasted temperature, date/time, humidity, and other weather-related parameters.

In the second step, I extracted only the required information (Date-Time and Temperature). I used the pandas library to store this extracted data in a DataFrame. Using pandas made it easy to organize and manipulate the data. I also printed the first few rows of the DataFrame to verify that the data was fetched correctly.

In the third step, I visualized the temperature forecast using the matplotlib library. A line graph was plotted where the x-axis represented the date and time, and the y-axis represented the temperature in degrees Celsius. The graph clearly showed how temperature changes over the forecast period. Visualization helps in understanding trends more easily than raw numbers.

Through this task, I learned how to connect Python with a real-time API, handle JSON data, convert it into a DataFrame, and generate graphical insights. This task improved my understanding of data analytics, Python libraries, and how real-world applications use APIs to fetch live data.
